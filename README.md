# PyAflow

PyAflow is a user-friendly Python interface to the Aflow API, designed to simplify access to AFLOW data. While the project is currently in development, it is fully functional as a standalone code. Please be aware that we may introduce breaking changes to the code without prior notification.

**Note:** This wrapper utilizes AFLOW data but is not developed or maintained by the AFLOW Consortium.
